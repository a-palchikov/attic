* Issues:
	userdump stream handling disabled : it is probably better delegated to a post-processing step since 3rd parties will almost certainly re-use next available stream id for something private - I know of one such case and it ain't WindowHandleInfoStream
	exception stream : number of parameters is not NumberParameters but EXCEPTION_MAXIMUM_PARAMETERS
	when run from command line, open() dump files in binary mode
